### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a grad student researcher exploring microbiome, differential gene expression, and physiology of corals in relationship to plastic pollution and heat stress.
You can check out what I'm currently working on [here](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/) in my open-lab notebook.
